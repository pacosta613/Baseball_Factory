Baseball_Factory

This app was created to allow baseball leagues to enter their divisions, along with teams and players. As of right now, its purpose is to create a full roster for each team. 

To run this app:

1. $ bundle install

2. $ rake db:migrate db:seed


FYI - Later I will expand on this project adding features like allowing certain admins to put in the statistical outcome of each game and players. A chart comparing statistics of players and teams such as mlb.com website and schedules. If you have any suggestions for the app, feel free to email me at pedro.acosta613@gmail.com and I'll be sure to take your recommendation into consideration.

Thanks! I hope you enjoy what I've built thus far.
